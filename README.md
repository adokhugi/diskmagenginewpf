Diskmag Engine in C# / WPF

This is a simple but good diskmag engine in WPF. Articles have to be added to the component/Texts folder, stored as .rtf files. Inside the method InitMenu, articles have to be added following this example:

            menu.Children.Add(AddArticle("metaphysics", "The Synthesis of Metaphysics and Jungian Personality Theory"));

Here, "metaphysics" is the file name without the extension ".rtf", and "The Synthesis of Metaphysics and Jungian Personality Theory" is the name of the article to be displayed in the menu.

Enjoy!
